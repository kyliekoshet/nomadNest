SECURITY SETUP TASKS
-------------------
1. Google Cloud Storage Privacy Setup
   [ ] Go to Google Cloud Console
   [ ] Find the bucket "nomads-nest-profile-pics"
   [ ] Remove public access:
       - Run in terminal: gsutil iam rm allUsers:objectViewer gs://nomads-nest-profile-pics
   [ ] Set up signed URLs instead:
       - Add to app.py:
         - Import: from datetime import timedelta
         - Create function to generate temporary signed URLs
         - URLs will expire after set time (like 1 hour)
       - This way only authenticated users can view images
   [ ] Test that public URLs no longer work
   [ ] Test that signed URLs work correctly

2. JWT (JSON Web Token) Security
   [ ] Change the JWT secret key:
       - Never use 'your-secret-key-here'
       - Generate a strong random key
       - Put it in .env file
       - Don't share it anywhere
   
   [ ] Set proper token expiration:
       - Currently set to 1 hour
       - Decide if this is right for your app
       - Maybe add refresh tokens
   
   [ ] Add to JWT tokens:
       - User role (admin/regular)
       - User ID
       - Any other important user info
   
   [ ] Test JWT security:
       - Try using expired tokens
       - Try using fake tokens
       - Try accessing admin stuff with regular user token

3. Next Steps After Security
   [ ] Add user roles (admin/regular)
   [ ] Add password reset
   [ ] Add email verification
   [ ] Add login attempts limit
   [ ] Add "forgot password"

Remember:
- Keep your service account key safe
- Never commit .env file
- Backup your security settings
